								<li>International movement of people from foreign countries in to the US</li>
								<li>Nearly 14 million immigrants entered the US from 2000-2010, and 10 million illegal immigrants in 2016</li>
								<li>California, New York, Texas, Florida, New Jersey, and Illinois account for 58% of illegal immigrants</li>
								<li>Syrians have fled their country and came to the US to escape the Syrian Civil War</li>

							</ul>

							<h3>2. The Candidate's Position</h3>
							<h6>Shan</h6>
							<p>
								The president believes in a strict immigration policy. Current policies are the deportation of immigrants who have
								arrived into the United States illegally, and restrict visa from some middle eastern countries. The Republican Party
								led by President Neelay Trivedi believes in immigration laws and immigration reforms that address the needs of national
								security. The president has always been divided on to exactly what extent immigration laws should be tightened, but as a
								whole he believes that the system needs to be in place to ensure that immigrants who enter this country illegally are not
								provided with the same benefits that legal citizens are. “Illegal immigrants place huge burdens on the economies of border
								states and the country as a whole. Every house can only hold so many people and we need to make sure that we protect this
								house.” Furthemore, President Trivedi believes in warmly welcoming those who enter the country through legal methods, while
								devoting extra resources to keep out those who try to enter via illegal methods, as well as keeping track of those who enter
								and when they leave. “For the US to remain competitive we need to attract the best and brightest people to our country. This
								means creating a merit based system that rewards workers with advanced degrees, innovative ideas and genuine desire to
								live the American Dream.” Lastly, President Trivedi believes in a rugged policy towards the middle eastern countries,
								“Above all the president is responsible for the safety of American citizens. Allowing large numbers of refugees middle
								eastern nations, poses a significant national security threat. We cannot take a change, even the smallest, because the
								price for negligence is to high”.

							<ul>
								<li>“A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.”</li>
								<li>The issue being argued is about how to interpret the second amendment: how can we balance the need for safety while being careful to not infringe upon individual liberties?</li>
								<li>Is there an effective way to reach a centrist position on gun control measures; that is, implement strategies to reduce the quantity of guns used in unsafe situations without interfering with gun use amongst responsible, verified owners?</li>

							<h3>2. The Candidate's Position</h3>
							<h6>Adnan</h6>
							<p>
								We take a centrist position on gun control policy. We recognize there are issues concerning safety in schools and other public venues
								but maintain that the right to bear arms is a fundamental right and can be integrated into a safe American society. The following are
								the central tenets of our stance: 
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>The right to obtain and store ammunition only with registration</li>
								<li>Regulate access to hunting grounds and shooting ranges to individuals of a certain age (21) and registration requirement.</li>
								<li>Implement federal licensing of guns to prevent illegal/irresponsible gun ownership and facilitate the process of confiscating guns when registration/ID requirements have not been met.</li>
								<li>Implement features such as child safety feature locks and gun safety tests.</li>
								<li>Federal funding for prosecution in gun crime lawsuits.</li>

								<li>Gun control laws do not deter crime; gun ownership deters crime.</li>
								<ul>
									<li>A study in Applied Economics Letters found that "assault weapons bans did not significantly affect murder rates at the state level" and "states with restrictions on the carrying of concealed weapons had higher gun-related murders."</li>
									<li>While gun ownership doubled in the twentieth century, the murder rate decreased.</li>
									<li>John R. Lott, Jr., PhD, author of More Guns, Less Crime: Understanding Crime and Gun Control Laws, stated, "States with the largest increases in gun ownership also have the largest drops in violent crimes... The effect on 'shall-issue' [concealed gun] laws on these crimes [where two or more people were killed] has been dramatic. When states passed these laws, the number of multiple-victim shootings declined by 84 percent. Deaths from these shootings plummeted on average by 90 percent and injuries by 82 percent."</li>
								</ul>
								<li>Gun control laws will not prevent criminals from obtaining guns or breaking laws.</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Of 62 mass shootings in the United States between 1982 and 2012, 49 of the shooters used legally obtained guns. Collectively, 143 guns were possessed by the killers with about 75% obtained legally.</li>
									<li>John R. Lott, Jr., PhD, gun rights activist, stated, "The problem with such [gun control] laws is that they take away guns from law-abiding citizens, while would-be criminals ignore them."</li>

								<li>The second amendment does not grant anyone the right to keep and bear arms, it allows for the state to regulate a militia. It is the federal government’s job to protect the people, not the people protecting themselves with arms.</li>
								<li>"My biggest frustration so far is the fact that this society has not been willing to take some basic steps to keep guns out of the hands of people who can do just unbelievable damage. We're the only developed country on Earth where this happens. ... And it happens once a week. And it's a one-day story. ... The country has to do some soul-searching on this." -Obama</li>
								<li>Obama finds that the country needs to take a more aggressive approach on gun control given that gun violence has become a regular thing.</li>

								<li>Clinton believes that not all guns should be restricted, however, there must be an increase in gun registration laws.</li>
								<li>“We’ve got to do something. It’s a very difficult political issue.

							<h3>1. About the Issue</h3>
							<h6>Amay</h6>
							<p>
								Protecting the environment has become more important to the Americans over the years. With the publication of Silent Spring
								by Rachel Carson, the public became aware of the impact of the pesticide DDT. As a result, this compound was banned, and
								eventually the Environmental Protection Agency was created by President Nixon. Since then, the issues around environmental
								protection and regulation have morphed from dealing with pure science into ones which need to balance the competing needs of
								keeping people healthy while allowing economic development and prosperity. The key issues facing people today include: (i)
								Global Warming/Climate Change, (ii) Reduction in harmful pollutants in the air and water, (iii) Managing wildlife to ensure
								biodiversity. Climate change refers to the impact of rising levels of greenhouse gases (gases that cause the temperature of
								the atmosphere is rise) in the atmosphere. With increased concentrations of these gases, the overall temperature in the
								atmosphere increases, and is causing changes in weather patterns and temperatures. While most people think of these changes
								as causing increased temperatures, they actually are causing increased extreme events, including colder temperatures in some
								locations and higher temperature in others. Keeping clean air and water for people and animals is another goal of environmental
								regulation and politics. However, it is not just as simple as stopping pollution. Economic development of a nation causes
								industries to release waste materials from factories. How much of each substance and how it can be released is the subject of
								environmental regulation. Sometimes, the regulations cause industries to close down, or force them to switch raw materials. For
								example, restrictions introduced by President Obama under the clean air act, are forcing Power Plants to consider switching
								from coal to natural gas. Finally, managing wildlife is another environmental issue. While humans are the largest species on
								Earth, there are millions of other species that call this plant home. However, many of them live in areas that humans want to
								develop for their own economic needs. How to balance the needs of the competing interests of human economic development and
								protection of these species is the role of environmental policy. For example, reintroducing wolves into Yellowstone has
								enabled the ecosystem to become rebalanced. However at the same time, wolves have been known to attack and kill cattle being
								raised by ranchers in the area. How to protect important wild species while also protecting the economic rights of people in
								the area is a difficult balancing act that politicians need to deal with.

							<h3>2. The Candidate's Position</h3>
							<h6>Brianna</h6>
							<p>
								Protecting the environment is a necessary goal that this administration strongly believes in accomplishing and supporting.
								Full government regulation is the most apparent option to change the worsening state of the environment, through business
								friendly regulations that still support free trade options. This in turn, will ensure that businesses are not hurt by
								regulations and efforts to lower the global temperature through the limiting of climate-altering pollution. The Paris
								Climate Agreement, while essential to combat climate change through the lowering of greenhouse gas emissions, ultimately
								does not fully embody the vision of this administration. This is why we support the renegotiation of the agreement, to
								include a carbon tax system, a cost-effective way to decrease greenhouse gas emissions. The implementation of a carbon tax
								system will serve to increase support for renewable energy sources, such as solar panels or wind turbines, that do not emit
								carbon dioxide. Giving block grants to the states for environmental funding will allow for them to allocate the funds as
								they desire, to support issues more pressing in concern to them individually. 
							</p>
							<p>
								“As the pioneer of environmentalism a century ago, the Republican Party reaffirms the moral obligation to be good stewards
								of the God-given natural beauty and resources of our country.”
								-Republican 2016 Platform
							</p>
							<p>
								This emphasizes the beliefs of this administration in regards to protecting the natural environment through the implementation
								of a carbon tax system and state funding. The Republican Party ultimately aims to preserve the environment, and does not deny
								climate change is an increasing issue of international concern. 
							</p>
							<p>
								“We firmly believe environmental problems are best solved by giving incentives for human ingenuity and the development of
								new technologies, not through top-down, command-and-control regulations that stifle economic growth and cost thousands of jobs.”
								-Republican 2016 Platform
							</p>
							<p>
								This illustrates how the Republican Party fully supports giving block grants to the states to use their discretion to decide
								which environmental matters most urgently need support and funding. Categorical grants are not the solution, and only serve
								to force the states into coercion to replicate the federal government’s agenda. New technology, such as wind turbines are a
								positive and clean source of energy, as opposed to fuels that emit carbon dioxide, increasing greenhouse gas emissions.

	<li>Shows that over last four climatic cycles, natural global warming has preceded global increases in CO2</li>
</ul>
<li><i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i> published in 2010 that 460-445 million years ago, CO2 levels were five times as high as they are today and during that time there was an intense period of glaciation, not warming </li>
<li>Ecologist and former Director of Greenpeace International Patrick Moore, PhD said, “there is some correlation, but little evidence, to support a direct causal relationship between CO2 and global temperature through the millennia.”</li>
<li>2011 study published in Asia-Pacific Journal of Atmospheric Science</li>
<ul>
	<li>Many climate models predict additional global warming to be the result of CO@ emissions but many of these models “exaggerate positive feedbacks and even show positive feedbacks when actual feedbacks are negative.”</li>
</ul>
<li>50% of CO2 that has come from burning fossil fuels and human activities in general has been absorbed by the earth’s carbon sinks</li>
<li>2010 study from the <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i></li>
<ul>
	<li>Forest growth rates are increasing because of greater CO2 levels which results in lower atmospheric CO2 levels in a negative feedback.</li>
</ul>
<li>2012 study in <i>Nature</i></li>
<ul>
	<li>Rate of global carbon uptake by earth’s carbon sinks (forests, oceans, etc.) is increasing and even doubled from 1960-2010.</li>
</ul>
<li>According to William Happer who has a PhD and is a Professor of Physics at Princeton University</li>
<ul>
	<li>“Additional increments of CO2 will cause relatively less direct warming because we already have so much CO2 in the atmosphere that it has blocked most of the infrared radiation that it can. The technical jargon for this is that CO2 absorption band is nearly ‘saturated’ at current CO2 levels.”</li>
</ul>
<li>Heartland Institute’s 2013 Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change reported that</li>
<ul>
	<li>“It is likely rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations will have little impact on future climate.”</li>
</ul>
<li>2007 study published in <i>Energy & Environment</i></li>
<ul>
	<li>“Variations in solar activity and not the burning of fossil fuels are the direct cause of the observed multi year variations in climatic responses.”</li>
</ul>
<li>Willie Soon, PhD, Physicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics did a study in 2012 that found a strong correlation between solar radiation and temperatures in the Arctic over past 130 years.</li>
<li>2012 study in Journal of <i>Atmospheric and Solar- Terrestrial Physics</i></li>
<ul>
	<li>“Up to 70% of the observed post 1850 climate change and warming could be associated to multiple solar cycles.”</li>
</ul>
<li>In its 2013 report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found that there was a slowdown in global warming over the past 15 years</li>
<li>Heartland Institute’s 2013 NIPCC report</li>
<ul>
	<li>“The earth has not warmed significantly for the past 16 years despite an 8% increase in atmospheric CO2.”</li>
</ul>
<li>2014 study in Open Journal of Statistics found that there is slowdown in global warming when looking at surface temperature records and satellite measurements of the lower atmosphere.</li>
<li>Richard Lindzen, PhD, Emeritus Professor of Meteorology at MIT stated that the IPCC”s “excuse for the absence of warming over the past 17 years is that the heat is hiding in the deep ocean. However, this is simply an admission that the [climate] models fail to simulate the exchanges of heat between the surface layers and the deeper oceans.”</li>
<li>2014 report by Global Warming Policy Foundation</li>
<ul>
	<li>Slow global sea level rise has been going on for 10,000 years </li>
</ul>
<li>18,000 years ago, sea levels were 400 feet lower than they are today and they have been slowly increasing every since</li>
<li>pH of average ocean surface water is 8.1</li>
<ul>
	<li>Since beginning of industrial revolution it has only decreased 0.1</li>
