							<h3>About the Issue</h3>
							<h6>Emiline</h6>
							<ul>
								<li>International movement of people from foreign countries in to the US</li>
								<li>Nearly 14 million immigrants entered the US from 2000-2010, and 10 million illegal immigrants in 2016</li>
								<li>California, New York, Texas, Florida, New Jersey, and Illinois account for 58% of illegal immigrants</li>
								<li>Syrians have fled their country and came to the US to escape the Syrian Civil War</li>
								<li>Over half the country’s population has been killed or forced to leave their homes</li>
							</ul>

							<h3>The Candidate's Position</h3>
							<h6>Shan</h6>
							<p>
								The president believes in a strict immigration policy. Current policies are the deportation of immigrants who have
								arrived into the United States illegally, and restrict visa from some middle eastern countries. The Republican Party
								led by President Neelay Trivedi believes in immigration laws and immigration reforms that address the needs of national
								security. The president has always been divided on to exactly what extent immigration laws should be tightened, but as a
								whole he believes that the system needs to be in place to ensure that immigrants who enter this country illegally are not
								provided with the same benefits that legal citizens are. “Illegal immigrants place huge burdens on the economies of border
								states and the country as a whole. Every house can only hold so many people and we need to make sure that we protect this
								house.” Furthemore, President Trivedi believes in warmly welcoming those who enter the country through legal methods, while
								devoting extra resources to keep out those who try to enter via illegal methods, as well as keeping track of those who enter
								and when they leave. “For the US to remain competitive we need to attract the best and brightest people to our country. This
								means creating a merit based system that rewards workers with advanced degrees, innovative ideas and genuine desire to
								live the American Dream.” Lastly, President Trivedi believes in a rugged policy towards the middle eastern countries,
								“Above all the president is responsible for the safety of American citizens. Allowing large numbers of refugees middle
								eastern nations, poses a significant national security threat. We cannot take a change, even the smallest, because the
								price for negligence is to high”.

							<h3>About the Issue</h3>
							<h6>Adnan</h6>
							<ul>
								<li>“A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.”</li>
								<li>The issue being argued is about how to interpret the second amendment: how can we balance the need for safety while being careful to not infringe upon individual liberties?</li>
								<li>Is there an effective way to reach a centrist position on gun control measures; that is, implement strategies to reduce the quantity of guns used in unsafe situations without interfering with gun use amongst responsible, verified owners?</li>
							</ul>

							<h3>The Candidate's Position</h3>
							<h6>Adnan</h6>
							<p>
								We take a centrist position on gun control policy. We recognize there are issues concerning safety in schools and other public venues
								but maintain that the right to bear arms is a fundamental right and can be integrated into a safe American society. The following are
								the central tenets of our stance: 
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>The right to obtain and store ammunition only with registration</li>
								<li>Regulate access to hunting grounds and shooting ranges to individuals of a certain age (21) and registration requirement.</li>
								<li>Implement federal licensing of guns to prevent illegal/irresponsible gun ownership and facilitate the process of confiscating guns when registration/ID requirements have not been met.</li>
								<li>Implement features such as child safety feature locks and gun safety tests.</li>
								<li>Federal funding for prosecution in gun crime lawsuits.</li>
								<li>We will recognize the right of the NRA to fund and support candidates for office.</li>
								<li>Technical innovation needed to fix core gun issues</li>
							</ul>

							<h3>Supporting Facts</h3>
							<h6>Patrick</h6>
							<ul>
								<li>Gun control laws do not deter crime; gun ownership deters crime.</li>
								<ul>
									<li>A study in Applied Economics Letters found that "assault weapons bans did not significantly affect murder rates at the state level" and "states with restrictions on the carrying of concealed weapons had higher gun-related murders."</li>
									<li>While gun ownership doubled in the twentieth century, the murder rate decreased.</li>
									<li>John R. Lott, Jr., PhD, author of More Guns, Less Crime: Understanding Crime and Gun Control Laws, stated, "States with the largest increases in gun ownership also have the largest drops in violent crimes... The effect on 'shall-issue' [concealed gun] laws on these crimes [where two or more people were killed] has been dramatic. When states passed these laws, the number of multiple-victim shootings declined by 84 percent. Deaths from these shootings plummeted on average by 90 percent and injuries by 82 percent."</li>
								</ul>
								<li>Gun control laws will not prevent criminals from obtaining guns or breaking laws.</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Of 62 mass shootings in the United States between 1982 and 2012, 49 of the shooters used legally obtained guns. Collectively, 143 guns were possessed by the killers with about 75% obtained legally.</li>
									<li>John R. Lott, Jr., PhD, gun rights activist, stated, "The problem with such [gun control] laws is that they take away guns from law-abiding citizens, while would-be criminals ignore them."</li>
								</ul>

							<h6>Vincent</h6>
							<ul>
								<li>Quotes from NRA Executive VP Wayne LaPierre</li>
								<ul>
									<li>“Politicians pass laws for gun-free school zones. They issue press releases bragging about them. They post signs advertising, and in doing so, they tell every insane killer in America that schools are the safest place to inflict maximum mayhem with minimum risk.”</li>
									<li>“The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.”</li>
									<li>“With all the foreign aid the US does… can’t we afford to put a police officer in every single school.”</li>
								</ul>
								<li>Quotes from President Donald Trump</li>
								<ul>
									<li>“Gun and magazine bans are a total failure.”</li>
									<li>“What we need to do is fix the system we have and make it work as intended. What we don’t need to do is expand a broken system.”</li>
									<li>“Maybe we could make it much more comprehensive and have one bill instead of 15 different bills that nobody knows what’s happening.”</li>

							<h6>Sofia</h6>
							<ul>
								<li>“While responsible gun ownership is part of the fabric of many communities, too many families in America have suffered from gun violence...we will expand and strengthen background checks and close dangerous loopholes in our current laws.”</li>
								<li>The second amendment does not grant anyone the right to keep and bear arms, it allows for the state to regulate a militia. It is the federal government’s job to protect the people, not the people protecting themselves with arms.</li>
								<li>"My biggest frustration so far is the fact that this society has not been willing to take some basic steps to keep guns out of the hands of people who can do just unbelievable damage. We're the only developed country on Earth where this happens. ... And it happens once a week. And it's a one-day story. ... The country has to do some soul-searching on this." -Obama</li>
								<li>Obama finds that the country needs to take a more aggressive approach on gun control given that gun violence has become a regular thing.</li>
								<li>“I’m not here to take away your guns,” Clinton said during her speech at the DNC. “I just don’t want you to be shot by someone who shouldn’t have a gun in the first place.”</li>
								<li>Clinton believes that not all guns should be restricted, however, there must be an increase in gun registration laws.</li>
								<li>“We’ve got to do something. It’s a very difficult political issue. But we are smart enough, compassionate enough to balance legitimate Second Amendment rights concerns with preventive measures and control measures, so whatever motivated this murderer … we will not see more needless, senseless deaths.” -Clinton</li>
								<li>Clinton sees the importance in the Second Amendment, however, also wants to balance it out with more gun restriction laws.</li>

							<h3>About the Issue</h3>
							<h6>Amay</h6>
							<p>
								Protecting the environment has become more important to the Americans over the years. With the publication of Silent Spring
								by Rachel Carson, the public became aware of the impact of the pesticide DDT. As a result, this compound was banned, and
								eventually the Environmental Protection Agency was created by President Nixon. Since then, the issues around environmental
								protection and regulation have morphed from dealing with pure science into ones which need to balance the competing needs of
								keeping people healthy while allowing economic development and prosperity. The key issues facing people today include: (i)
								Global Warming/Climate Change, (ii) Reduction in harmful pollutants in the air and water, (iii) Managing wildlife to ensure
								biodiversity. Climate change refers to the impact of rising levels of greenhouse gases (gases that cause the temperature of
								the atmosphere is rise) in the atmosphere. With increased concentrations of these gases, the overall temperature in the
								atmosphere increases, and is causing changes in weather patterns and temperatures. While most people think of these changes
								as causing increased temperatures, they actually are causing increased extreme events, including colder temperatures in some
								locations and higher temperature in others. Keeping clean air and water for people and animals is another goal of environmental
								regulation and politics. However, it is not just as simple as stopping pollution. Economic development of a nation causes
								industries to release waste materials from factories. How much of each substance and how it can be released is the subject of
								environmental regulation. Sometimes, the regulations cause industries to close down, or force them to switch raw materials. For
								example, restrictions introduced by President Obama under the clean air act, are forcing Power Plants to consider switching
								from coal to natural gas. Finally, managing wildlife is another environmental issue. While humans are the largest species on
								Earth, there are millions of other species that call this plant home. However, many of them live in areas that humans want to
								develop for their own economic needs. How to balance the needs of the competing interests of human economic development and
								protection of these species is the role of environmental policy. For example, reintroducing wolves into Yellowstone has
								enabled the ecosystem to become rebalanced. However at the same time, wolves have been known to attack and kill cattle being
								raised by ranchers in the area. How to protect important wild species while also protecting the economic rights of people in
								the area is a difficult balancing act that politicians need to deal with.

							<h3>The Candidate's Position</h3>
							<h6>Brianna</h6>
							<p>
								Protecting the environment is a necessary goal that this administration strongly believes in accomplishing and supporting.
								Full government regulation is the most apparent option to change the worsening state of the environment, through business
								friendly regulations that still support free trade options. This in turn, will ensure that businesses are not hurt by
								regulations and efforts to lower the global temperature through the limiting of climate-altering pollution. The Paris
								Climate Agreement, while essential to combat climate change through the lowering of greenhouse gas emissions, ultimately
								does not fully embody the vision of this administration. This is why we support the renegotiation of the agreement, to
								include a carbon tax system, a cost-effective way to decrease greenhouse gas emissions. The implementation of a carbon tax
								system will serve to increase support for renewable energy sources, such as solar panels or wind turbines, that do not emit
								carbon dioxide. Giving block grants to the states for environmental funding will allow for them to allocate the funds as
								they desire, to support issues more pressing in concern to them individually. 
							</p>
							<p>
								“As the pioneer of environmentalism a century ago, the Republican Party reaffirms the moral obligation to be good stewards
								of the God-given natural beauty and resources of our country.”
								-Republican 2016 Platform
							</p>
							<p>
								This emphasizes the beliefs of this administration in regards to protecting the natural environment through the implementation
								of a carbon tax system and state funding. The Republican Party ultimately aims to preserve the environment, and does not deny
								climate change is an increasing issue of international concern. 
							</p>
							<p>
								“We firmly believe environmental problems are best solved by giving incentives for human ingenuity and the development of
								new technologies, not through top-down, command-and-control regulations that stifle economic growth and cost thousands of jobs.”
								-Republican 2016 Platform
							</p>
							<p>
								This illustrates how the Republican Party fully supports giving block grants to the states to use their discretion to decide
								which environmental matters most urgently need support and funding. Categorical grants are not the solution, and only serve
								to force the states into coercion to replicate the federal government’s agenda. New technology, such as wind turbines are a
								positive and clean source of energy, as opposed to fuels that emit carbon dioxide, increasing greenhouse gas emissions.
