							<h3>About the Issue</h3>
							<h6>Emiline</h6>
							<ul>
								<li>International movement of people from foreign countries in to the US</li>
								<li>Nearly 14 million immigrants entered the US from 2000-2010, and 10 million illegal immigrants in 2016</li>
								<li>California, New York, Texas, Florida, New Jersey, and Illinois account for 58% of illegal immigrants</li>
								<li>Syrians have fled their country and came to the US to escape the Syrian Civil War</li>
								<li>Over half the country’s population has been killed or forced to leave their homes</li>
							</ul>

							<h3>The Candidate's Position</h3>
							<h6>Shan</h6>
							<p>
								The president believes in a strict immigration policy. Current policies are the deportation of immigrants who have
								arrived into the United States illegally, and restrict visa from some middle eastern countries. The Republican Party
								led by President Neelay Trivedi believes in immigration laws and immigration reforms that address the needs of national
								security. The president has always been divided on to exactly what extent immigration laws should be tightened, but as a
								whole he believes that the system needs to be in place to ensure that immigrants who enter this country illegally are not
								provided with the same benefits that legal citizens are. “Illegal immigrants place huge burdens on the economies of border
								states and the country as a whole. Every house can only hold so many people and we need to make sure that we protect this
								house.” Furthemore, President Trivedi believes in warmly welcoming those who enter the country through legal methods, while
								devoting extra resources to keep out those who try to enter via illegal methods, as well as keeping track of those who enter
								and when they leave. “For the US to remain competitive we need to attract the best and brightest people to our country. This
								means creating a merit based system that rewards workers with advanced degrees, innovative ideas and genuine desire to
								live the American Dream.” Lastly, President Trivedi believes in a rugged policy towards the middle eastern countries,
								“Above all the president is responsible for the safety of American citizens. Allowing large numbers of refugees middle
								eastern nations, poses a significant national security threat. We cannot take a change, even the smallest, because the
								price for negligence is to high”.
