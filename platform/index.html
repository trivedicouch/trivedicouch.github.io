								<li>International movement of people from foreign countries in to the US</li>
								<li>Nearly 14 million immigrants entered the US from 2000-2010, and 10 million illegal immigrants in 2016</li>
								<li>California, New York, Texas, Florida, New Jersey, and Illinois account for 58% of illegal immigrants</li>
								<li>Syrians have fled their country and came to the US to escape the Syrian Civil War</li>

							</ul>

							<h3>2. The Candidate's Position</h3>
							<h6>Shan</h6>
							<p>
								The president believes in a strict immigration policy. Current policies are the deportation of immigrants who have
								arrived into the United States illegally, and restrict visa from some middle eastern countries. The Republican Party
								led by President Neelay Trivedi believes in immigration laws and immigration reforms that address the needs of national
								security. The president has always been divided on to exactly what extent immigration laws should be tightened, but as a
								whole he believes that the system needs to be in place to ensure that immigrants who enter this country illegally are not
								provided with the same benefits that legal citizens are. “Illegal immigrants place huge burdens on the economies of border
								states and the country as a whole. Every house can only hold so many people and we need to make sure that we protect this
								house.” Furthemore, President Trivedi believes in warmly welcoming those who enter the country through legal methods, while
								devoting extra resources to keep out those who try to enter via illegal methods, as well as keeping track of those who enter
								and when they leave. “For the US to remain competitive we need to attract the best and brightest people to our country. This
								means creating a merit based system that rewards workers with advanced degrees, innovative ideas and genuine desire to
								live the American Dream.” Lastly, President Trivedi believes in a rugged policy towards the middle eastern countries,
								“Above all the president is responsible for the safety of American citizens. Allowing large numbers of refugees middle
								eastern nations, poses a significant national security threat. We cannot take a change, even the smallest, because the
								price for negligence is to high”.

							<ul>
								<li>“A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.”</li>
								<li>The issue being argued is about how to interpret the second amendment: how can we balance the need for safety while being careful to not infringe upon individual liberties?</li>
								<li>Is there an effective way to reach a centrist position on gun control measures; that is, implement strategies to reduce the quantity of guns used in unsafe situations without interfering with gun use amongst responsible, verified owners?</li>

							<h3>2. The Candidate's Position</h3>
							<h6>Adnan</h6>
							<p>
								We take a centrist position on gun control policy. We recognize there are issues concerning safety in schools and other public venues
								but maintain that the right to bear arms is a fundamental right and can be integrated into a safe American society. The following are
								the central tenets of our stance: 
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>The right to obtain and store ammunition only with registration</li>
								<li>Regulate access to hunting grounds and shooting ranges to individuals of a certain age (21) and registration requirement.</li>
								<li>Implement federal licensing of guns to prevent illegal/irresponsible gun ownership and facilitate the process of confiscating guns when registration/ID requirements have not been met.</li>
								<li>Implement features such as child safety feature locks and gun safety tests.</li>
								<li>Federal funding for prosecution in gun crime lawsuits.</li>

								<li>Gun control laws do not deter crime; gun ownership deters crime.</li>
								<ul>
									<li>A study in Applied Economics Letters found that "assault weapons bans did not significantly affect murder rates at the state level" and "states with restrictions on the carrying of concealed weapons had higher gun-related murders."</li>
									<li>While gun ownership doubled in the twentieth century, the murder rate decreased.</li>
									<li>John R. Lott, Jr., PhD, author of More Guns, Less Crime: Understanding Crime and Gun Control Laws, stated, "States with the largest increases in gun ownership also have the largest drops in violent crimes... The effect on 'shall-issue' [concealed gun] laws on these crimes [where two or more people were killed] has been dramatic. When states passed these laws, the number of multiple-victim shootings declined by 84 percent. Deaths from these shootings plummeted on average by 90 percent and injuries by 82 percent."</li>
								</ul>
								<li>Gun control laws will not prevent criminals from obtaining guns or breaking laws.</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Of 62 mass shootings in the United States between 1982 and 2012, 49 of the shooters used legally obtained guns. Collectively, 143 guns were possessed by the killers with about 75% obtained legally.</li>
									<li>John R. Lott, Jr., PhD, gun rights activist, stated, "The problem with such [gun control] laws is that they take away guns from law-abiding citizens, while would-be criminals ignore them."</li>

								<li>The second amendment does not grant anyone the right to keep and bear arms, it allows for the state to regulate a militia. It is the federal government’s job to protect the people, not the people protecting themselves with arms.</li>
								<li>"My biggest frustration so far is the fact that this society has not been willing to take some basic steps to keep guns out of the hands of people who can do just unbelievable damage. We're the only developed country on Earth where this happens. ... And it happens once a week. And it's a one-day story. ... The country has to do some soul-searching on this." -Obama</li>
								<li>Obama finds that the country needs to take a more aggressive approach on gun control given that gun violence has become a regular thing.</li>
								<li>“I’m not here to take away your guns,” Clinton said during her speech at the DNC. “I just don’t want you to be shot by someone who shouldn’t have a gun in the first place.”</li>
								<li>Clinton believes that not all guns should be restricted, however, there must be an increase in gun registration laws.</li>
								<li>“We’ve got to do something. It’s a very difficult political issue.

							<h3>1. About the Issue</h3>
							<h6>Amay</h6>
							<p>
								Protecting the environment has become more important to the Americans over the years. With the publication of Silent Spring
								by Rachel Carson, the public became aware of the impact of the pesticide DDT. As a result, this compound was banned, and
								eventually the Environmental Protection Agency was created by President Nixon. Since then, the issues around environmental
								protection and regulation have morphed from dealing with pure science into ones which need to balance the competing needs of
								keeping people healthy while allowing economic development and prosperity. The key issues facing people today include: (i)
								Global Warming/Climate Change, (ii) Reduction in harmful pollutants in the air and water, (iii) Managing wildlife to ensure
								biodiversity. Climate change refers to the impact of rising levels of greenhouse gases (gases that cause the temperature of
								the atmosphere is rise) in the atmosphere. With increased concentrations of these gases, the overall temperature in the
								atmosphere increases, and is causing changes in weather patterns and temperatures. While most people think of these changes
								as causing increased temperatures, they actually are causing increased extreme events, including colder temperatures in some
								locations and higher temperature in others. Keeping clean air and water for people and animals is another goal of environmental
								regulation and politics. However, it is not just as simple as stopping pollution. Economic development of a nation causes
								industries to release waste materials from factories. How much of each substance and how it can be released is the subject of
								environmental regulation. Sometimes, the regulations cause industries to close down, or force them to switch raw materials. For
								example, restrictions introduced by President Obama under the clean air act, are forcing Power Plants to consider switching
								from coal to natural gas. Finally, managing wildlife is another environmental issue. While humans are the largest species on
								Earth, there are millions of other species that call this plant home. However, many of them live in areas that humans want to
								develop for their own economic needs. How to balance the needs of the competing interests of human economic development and
								protection of these species is the role of environmental policy. For example, reintroducing wolves into Yellowstone has
								enabled the ecosystem to become rebalanced. However at the same time, wolves have been known to attack and kill cattle being
								raised by ranchers in the area. How to protect important wild species while also protecting the economic rights of people in
								the area is a difficult balancing act that politicians need to deal with.

							<h3>2. The Candidate's Position</h3>
							<h6>Brianna</h6>
							<p>
								Protecting the environment is a necessary goal that this administration strongly believes in accomplishing and supporting.
								Full government regulation is the most apparent option to change the worsening state of the environment, through business
								friendly regulations that still support free trade options. This in turn, will ensure that businesses are not hurt by
								regulations and efforts to lower the global temperature through the limiting of climate-altering pollution. The Paris
								Climate Agreement, while essential to combat climate change through the lowering of greenhouse gas emissions, ultimately
								does not fully embody the vision of this administration. This is why we support the renegotiation of the agreement, to
								include a carbon tax system, a cost-effective way to decrease greenhouse gas emissions. The implementation of a carbon tax
								system will serve to increase support for renewable energy sources, such as solar panels or wind turbines, that do not emit
								carbon dioxide. Giving block grants to the states for environmental funding will allow for them to allocate the funds as
								they desire, to support issues more pressing in concern to them individually. 
							</p>
							<p>
								“As the pioneer of environmentalism a century ago, the Republican Party reaffirms the moral obligation to be good stewards
								of the God-given natural beauty and resources of our country.”
								-Republican 2016 Platform
							</p>
							<p>
								This emphasizes the beliefs of this administration in regards to protecting the natural environment through the implementation
								of a carbon tax system and state funding. The Republican Party ultimately aims to preserve the environment, and does not deny
								climate change is an increasing issue of international concern. 
							</p>
							<p>
								“We firmly believe environmental problems are best solved by giving incentives for human ingenuity and the development of
								new technologies, not through top-down, command-and-control regulations that stifle economic growth and cost thousands of jobs.”
								-Republican 2016 Platform
							</p>
							<p>
								This illustrates how the Republican Party fully supports giving block grants to the states to use their discretion to decide
								which environmental matters most urgently need support and funding. Categorical grants are not the solution, and only serve
								to force the states into coercion to replicate the federal government’s agenda. New technology, such as wind turbines are a
								positive and clean source of energy, as opposed to fuels that emit carbon dioxide, increasing greenhouse gas emissions.

								<li>According to William Happer who has a PhD and is a Professor of Physics at Princeton University</li>
								<ul>
									<li>“Additional increments of CO2 will cause relatively less direct warming because we already have so much CO2 in the atmosphere that it has blocked most of the infrared radiation that it can.

								<li>Source: <a href="https://democrats.org/issues/environment/" target="_blank">Democratic Party</a></li>
								<li>“Democrats believe that climate change poses a real and urgent threat to our economy, our national security, and our children’s health and futures, and that Americans deserve the jobs and security that come from becoming the clean energy superpower of the 21st century.” -Democratic Party Platform 2016</li>
								<li>Climate change is a threat across many aspects of American life</li>
								<li>Hillary Clinton pledged to power at least half of the nation's energy needs with renewable sources by 2030 and supported investment in clean renewable energy over fracking. She supported the Paris Agreement to combat climate change and opposed the Keystone XL pipeline and drilling in the Arctic</li>
								<li>Democratic candidate Clinton proposed using renewable energy sources over time so by 2030 there would be half of the energy as renewable</li>
								<li>“Climate change is an urgent threat and a defining challenge of our time. Fifteen of the 16 hottest years on record have occurred this century. While Donald Trump has called climate change a “hoax,” 2016 is on track to break global temperature records once more. Cities from Miami to Baltimore are already threatened by rising seas. California and the West have suffered years of brutal drought. Alaska has been scorched by wildfire. New York has been battered by superstorms, and Texas swamped by flash floods. The best science tells us that without ambitious, immediate action across our economy to cut carbon pollution and other greenhouse gases, all of these impacts will be far worse in the future. We cannot leave our children a planet that has been profoundly damaged.” - Dem Party Platform 2016</li>
								<li>“Democrats share a deep commitment to tackling the climate challenge; creating millions of good-paying middle class jobs; reducing greenhouse gas emissions more than 80 percent below 2005 levels by 2050; and meeting the pledge President Obama put forward in the landmark Paris Agreement, which aims to keep global temperature increases to “well below” two degrees Celsius and to pursue efforts to limit global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius. We believe America must be running entirely on clean energy by mid-century. We will take bold steps to slash carbon pollution and protect clean air at home, lead the fight against climate change around the world, ensure no Americans are left out or left behind as we accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy, and be responsible stewards of our natural resources and our public lands and waters. Democrats reject the notion that we have to choose between protecting our planet and creating good-paying jobs. We can and we will do both.” - Dem Party Platform 2016</li>
								<li>“We are committed to getting 50 percent of our electricity from clean energy sources within a decade, with half a billion solar panels installed within four years and enough renewable energy to power every home in the country. We will cut energy waste in American homes, schools, hospitals, and offices through energy efficient improvements; modernize our electric grid; and make American manufacturing the cleanest and most efficient in the world. These efforts will create millions of new jobs and save families and businesses money on their monthly energy bills. We will transform American transportation by reducing oil consumption through cleaner fuels, vehicle electrification increasing the fuel efficiency of cars, boilers, ships, and trucks. We will make new investments in public transportation and build bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure across our urban and suburban areas. Democrats believe the tax code must reflect our commitment to a clean energy future by eliminating special tax breaks and subsidies for fossil fuel companies as well as defending and extending tax incentives for energy efficiency and clean energy.” - Dem Party Platform 2016</li>
								<li>“Democrats believe clean air and clean water are basic rights of all Americans. Yet as we saw in Flint, Michigan, low-income communities and communities of color are disproportionately home to environmental justice “hot spots,” where air pollution, water pollution, and toxic hazards like lead increase health and economic hardship. The impacts of climate change will also disproportionately affect low-income and minority communities, tribal nations, and Alaska Native villages—all of which suffer the worst losses during extreme weather and have the fewest resources to prepare. Simply put, this is environmental racism.” - Dem Party Platform 2016</li>

							<h3>6. Opposing Facts</h3>
							<h6>Gabi</h6>
							<ul>
								<li><b>Evidence of climate change - <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/" target="_blank">NASA</a></b></li>
								<li>Global Temperature Rise</li>
								<ul>
									<li>The planet's average surface temperature has risen about 1.62 degrees Fahrenheit (0.9 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions into the atmosphere.</li>
								</ul>
								<li>Warming Oceans</li>
								<ul>
									<li>The oceans have absorbed much of this increased heat, with the top 700 meters (about 2,300 feet) of ocean showing warming of more than 0.4 degrees Fahrenheit since 1969.</li>
								</ul>
								<li>Shrinking Ice Sheets</li>
								<ul>
									<li>The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass. Data from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment show Greenland lost an average of 286 billion tons of ice per year between 1993 and 2016, while Antarctica lost about 127 billion tons of ice per year during the same time period. The rate of Antarctica ice mass loss has tripled in the last decade.</li>
								</ul>
								<li>Glacial Retreat</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Glaciers are retreating almost everywhere around the world — including in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska and Africa.</li>
								</ul>
								<li>Decreased Snow Cover</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Satellite observations reveal that the amount of spring snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere has decreased over the past five decades and that the snow is melting earlier.</li>
								</ul>
								<li>Sea Level Rise</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Global sea level rose about 8 inches in the last century. The rate in the last two decades, however, is nearly double that of the last century and is accelerating slightly every year.</li>
								</ul>
								<li>Declining Arctic Sea Ice</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Both the extent and thickness of Arctic sea ice has declined rapidly over the last several decades.</li>
								</ul>
								<li>Extreme Events</li>
								<ul>
									<li>The number of record high temperature events in the United States has been increasing, while the number of record low temperature events has been decreasing, since 1950. The U.S. has also witnessed increasing numbers of intense rainfall events.</li>
								</ul>
								<li>Ocean Acidification</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the acidity of surface ocean waters has increased by about 30 percent.This increase is the result of humans emitting more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and hence more being absorbed into the oceans. The amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by the upper layer of the oceans is increasing by about 2 billion tons per year.</li>
