				Neelay loves all things practical. With diverse experiences in computer science research,
				studies of social systems and the Constitution, and in-person conversations with conservative
				political theorists, he’s grown to understand how the Republican party platform can fit in a fast-
				paced, technology-based society.
			</p>

				Neelay grew up in Warren, NJ, and has been surrounded by a conservative community in
				school and home. His childhood was based on principles of discipline, sophistication, and
				exemplary academic performance. A native of several educational initiatives in Warren, on
				national levels, and even on international scales, his shrewd analytical abilities have driven him
				to integrate mathematics and computer science with the humanities: “how can algorithms, game
				theory, and digital media provide insight into social behavior in political systems?” Neelay’s
				pushing to find out.

				Neelay takes pride in a strict interpretation of the Constitution and precedent established by the
				Supreme Court. He upholds the separation of church and state but defends the right to exercise
				religion as a fundamental one. He supports legislation to target gun control at its root - health
				care concerns and cultural stigmas - because he believes the American people deserve the
				liberty of bearing arms. After close study of the Court’s decision in Roe vs Wade, his policy
				towards abortion is to abide by its precedent, and in the context of immigration, national security
				is a priority. His experience in biological and chemical research has influenced his relatively
				liberal view on the environment: he supports preservation initiatives, but with cautious steps to
				not make decisions rashly. His financial perspective is pro-business minded and he supports the
				legalization of marijuana.

				Neelay is committed to putting America first, because an America first ensures an America
				forever. He recognizes current issues in national security, healthcare, immigration, and
				environmental issues, but promises to deliver to the people what they need and want: a portfolio
				of policy initiatives that stress individual liberties, construct national security, and build an
				America for everyone.

				Nick has known Neelay in many contexts in and outside of the political space. Although he has
				a more balanced perspective on policy matters, Nick complements Neelay’s conservative
				portfolio naturally: Nick supports fast, strict action on immigration, recognizes the need to
				address mental health cases in school shootings, and supports the adoption of environmental
				initiatives that honor corporate sovereignty.

				Nick grew up in Green Brook, NJ, and has seen the impact of liberal policy on local and national
				financial institutions, government organizations, and schools. He knows what it’s going to take
				to restore the financial capacity to many urban neighborhoods in the South, Midwest, and the
				Coasts. Nick has experience with financial data analysis and understands the components of a
				conservative platform that encourages social mobility while respecting individual freedoms. To
				him, there’s a trade-off between activism and violation of the people’s constitutional rights, and
				in his opinion, Democratic officials have exploited it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Nick grew up in a strong conservative community and supports the extension of conservative
				principles to social walks of life: restoring America to when America was first. He’s with Neelay,
				Neelay’s team, and Neelay’s goal for a better America.
